	# Given two Strings of equal length, 'merge' them into one String.
    # Do this by 'zipping' the Strings together.
    # Start with the first char of the first String.
    # Then add the first char from the second String.
    # Then add the second char from the first String.
    # And so on.
    # Maintain case.
    # You will not encounter whitespace.
    # For Example:
	# zipped("String","Fridge") → "SFtrriidngge"
	# zipped("Dog","Cat") → "DCoagt"
	# zipped("True","Tree") → "TTrrueee" 
	# zipped("return","letter") → "rleettutrenr"
